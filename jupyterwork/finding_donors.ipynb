    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "3. Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will list down in detail the reason and intuition behind choosing each model along with other questions asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)###\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One real-world Example####\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian Naive Bayes model has been widely used in the industry for text classification purposes. In particular for classifying and filtering spam emails (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering). This has also been used in medical fields to Classify a person’s cognitive activity, based on brain image. [Ref:http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_sp09/lectures/NBayes2_2-2-2009-ann.pdf].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths####\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fast training speed to quick inituition of obtainable accuracy or baseline on large dataset.\n",
    "2. Performs well when inputs are independent from one another, and when there are many features.\n",
    "3. Works well even in many complex real-world situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses ####\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplistic nature can yield bad generalizations or suboptimal solutions\n",
    "2. Relies on the independence assumption; \n",
    "3. Only works well with limited amount of features\n",
    "4. High bias when there is a small amount of data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?####\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will give us quick insights and baseline for any improvements. This is will also help us to justify the need of any complicated model to train for better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines####\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One real-world application in industry where the model can be applied####\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has been applied to the stock market to forecast movement of different markets, and found to work well in markets with either high volatility or lower volatility. In this case, Support Vector Machines were chosen because they tend to outperform other methods for financial time-series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths ####\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform well when there is a definite distinction between two classes\n",
    "2. Fast training speed\n",
    "3. Good for feature-intense data, e.g. text\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses####\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform badly when the classification problem is not binary\n",
    "2. Doesn't take into account all data equally, so can't see overall trends in data\n",
    "3. A good choice in kernel is required, which is not always clear as a goal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?####\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the problem is a binary classification, this model seems to be a good candidate fit to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)####\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One real-world application in industry where the model can be applied####\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods are used extensively in Kaggle competitions, usually in image detection. A real world example of Adaboost is object detection in image, ex: identifying players during a game of basketball. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths ####\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More robust than single estimators, have improved generalizability.\n",
    "2. Simple models can be combined to build a complex model, which is computationally fast\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses####\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Biased underlying classifier, leads to a biased boosted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?####\n",
    "\n",
    "The intention here to go for a complex models since there are enough features to build weak learners. Adaboost also seems to run faster with no base estimator hence choosing this model should certainly give more accuracy.\n"

    "AdaBoost is of a class of machine learning algorithm known as ensemble algorithms. As the name implies, ensemble algorithms combine the effects of multiple algorithms into one.

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

If training time was a important factor, training time descrease was of a higher order, I would consider using only the reduced data set to train the algorithm. However one important thing to note here is that the reduced features data F score is near .69 which is very low for a good model. It would make sense to actually use the full features disregard of training time to get a better F score."
